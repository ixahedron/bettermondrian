So Pebble servers are shutting down, but my physical watch is still kicking,  
so I'm going to put this quickly hacked together watchface here just to be safe. 

It's inspired by Piet Mondrian's painting Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow (1930)  
and is almost the same as the built-in Mondrian watchface, only with the date displayed  
and added vibration on Bluetooth connection loss.
